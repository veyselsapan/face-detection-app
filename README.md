# Face Detection Application

## Overview
This project is a Python-based face detection application. It utilizes machine learning (MTCNN) for accurate face detection and includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive user experience. The application offers real-time face detection through a webcam, allows users to load images from their disk for face detection, and supports capturing photos directly from the camera.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detect faces in real-time using a webcam.
- **Load Images**: Load images from disk to detect faces.
- **Capture Photos**: Take snapshots using the webcam for face detection.
- **Simple GUI**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

## Installation
Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This application was developed using Python 3.8.
